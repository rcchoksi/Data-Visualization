# Interactive bargraph with D3.js
The dataset(CoffeeData.csv) consists of sales and profits of different type of beverages in various states of United States. 
I was tasked with summing up the sales and profits values by region and by category for the whole dataset in D3.js.
The next task was to insert drop-downs for x and y axis labels. A bar chart was to be shown according to the labels selected on the dropdown.
The user could select any value for the x and y axis, and the bar chart would be updated accordingly.
The key challenges faced were correct labelling of the axes with appropriate tick-marks and accurate size of the bars according to the maximum value of sales/profits. 
The coffee.js file contains the functions required for updating the graph according to the X and Y dropdown values. 
The D3.js file provides the D3 functions needed to implement the visualization. 
The main.css file has the style rules required for the visualization.
NOTE: As a heads up, a local server might be needed to run the html file to visualize the graph.

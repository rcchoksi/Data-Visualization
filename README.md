# Interactive bargraph with D3.js
The dataset consists of sales and profits of different type of beverages in various states of United States. 
I was tasked with summing up the sales and profits values by region and by category for the whole dataset in D3.js.
The next task was to insert drop-downs for x and y axis labels. A bar chart was to be shown according to the labels selected on the dropdown.
The key challenges faced were correct labelling of the axes with appropriate tick-marks and accurate size of the bars according to the maximum value of sales/profits.
